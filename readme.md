# Course API
Very basic API for displaying course information. Still in development, but usable.

The basic idea is that all course information should be open for use and for debate. So if you think something should be different, report an issue and label it with feature request.

## install
1. Install node

2. Install package.json with NPM

3. Create a variables.env file and adjust the settings to your situation
```
HOST = '192.168.33.10';
PORT = 3000;
```
